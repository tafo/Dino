### Pull Requests

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`
2. Branch naming convention: `feature/your-feature-name`
3. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests
4. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation
5. Ensure the test suite passes
6. Make sure your code follows the existing code style
7. Issue that pull request!

## Development Setup

1. **Prerequisites**
   - .NET 9.0 SDK or later
   - Your favorite IDE (Visual Studio, VS Code, Rider)

2. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/tafo/dino.git
   cd dino
   ```

3. **Build the solution**
   ```bash
   dotnet build
   ```

4. **Run tests**
   ```bash
   dotnet test
   ```

## Coding Guidelines

### General Guidelines

- Write clean, readable, and maintainable code
- Follow C# naming conventions
- Keep methods small and focused
- Write meaningful commit messages
- Add XML documentation comments for public APIs
- Avoid unnecessary comments - code should be self-documenting

### C# Style Guide

- Use `var` when the type is obvious
- Use object initializers when possible
- Prefer LINQ over loops when it improves readability
- Use async/await for asynchronous operations
- Use nullable reference types

### Testing

- Write unit tests for all new functionality
- Use descriptive test names that explain what is being tested
- Follow the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern
- Use FluentAssertions for test assertions

### Example Test

```csharp
[Fact]
public void Parse_SimpleSelectQuery_ReturnsCorrectAst()
{
    // Arrange
    var parser = new DinoParser();
    var query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE age > 18";
    
    // Act
    var result = parser.Parse(query);
    
    // Assert
    result.Should().NotBeNull();
    result.SelectItems.Should().HaveCount(1);
    result.WhereClause.Should().NotBeNull();
}
```

## Adding New Features

1. **Lexer Tokens**: If adding new SQL keywords, update `DinoTokenCategory` enum
2. **Parser**: Add parsing logic in `DinoParser` for new syntax
3. **AST Nodes**: Create new node types inheriting from `DinoQueryNode`
4. **Visitor**: Update `IDinoQueryVisitor` and implement in `DinoExpressionVisitor`
5. **Tests**: Add comprehensive tests for the new feature

## Commit Messages

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line

### Examples

```
Add support for CASE WHEN expressions

- Implement CaseExpression AST node
- Add parsing logic for CASE/WHEN/THEN/ELSE/END
- Update expression visitor to handle CASE expressions
- Add comprehensive unit tests

Fixes #123
```

## Release Process

1. Update version numbers (follow Semantic Versioning)
2. Update CHANGELOG.md
3. Create a release tag
4. Build and publish NuGet packages

## Questions?

Feel free to open an issue with your question.
